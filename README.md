# 👋 Hi, I’m Peter Adebayo

🚀 **Hardware & Software Engineer | Systems Builder | Problem Solver**

I design and build software systems with an engineering-first mindset — from performance-critical logic to scalable backend services. I’m especially interested in how software interacts with hardware, networks, and real-world constraints.
